Support Json data format.<br>       For non data merged exported texture, support export Json data format as well as XML data format.<br>       For data merged exported texture, merged data is serialized AS object byte array. Data parse performance has a great improvement.<br>    2. Support import Spine data format<br>       Spine is a great 2D skeletal animation tool. It support skin and slot data structure. In V2.3, DragonBones also support skin and slot data structure. You can import Spine artworks into DragonBones designpanel.<br>    3. Great improve animation functionality<br>       Support animation layers, animation mixing and animation additive.<br>       Animation mixing allow you to cut down on the number of animations you have to create for your game by having some animations apply to part of the body only. This means such animations can be used together with other animations in various combinations.<br>       Regarding animation mixing weighting, DragonBones support normalized weighting(Using animation layer) as well as additive weighting(Using animation group).<br>    4. Improve design panel, support new version detection, oneline help.<br><b>Bug Fixing:</b><br>    1. Fix bug: In design panel, sometimes some text in UI disappear.<br>    2. Fix bug: Blank key frame in frame label layer make skeleton hierarchy not changable.<br><br><font size='20'><b>V2.2 Release Notes</b></font><br>V2.2 is incremental version of V2.1, including performance improvement and high priority bug fixing.<br>    1. Add Bone.displayList interface.<br>    2. Improve transform point performance.<br>    3. Improve performance when switching display frequently.<br>    4. Fix a old version compatibility related bug.<br>    5. Add GA in DesignPanel to track user behavior.<br><br><font size='20'><b>V2.1.1 Release Notes</b></font><br>V2.1.1 is a critical bug fixing version of V2.1<br>    1. Fix bug: export texture atlas incorrect and unusable.<br>    2. Improvement: Merge the Flex SDK shared library into code.<br><br><font size='20'><b>V2.1 Release Notes</b></font><br>V2.1 is incremental version of V2.0, including high priority bug fixing and documentation.<br>    1. Fix bug: sometimes DesignPanel cannot correctly launched.<br>    2. Fix bug: in Flash Pro, graphic's Brush width will be cut out of texture.<br>    3. Fix bug: export texture with zoom in scale will make the image blur.<br>    4. Fix bug: sometimes, tween from invisible to visible is incorrect.<br>    5. Updated API Spec<br>    6. Updated Tutorials.<br><br><font size='20'><b>V2.0 Release Notes</b></font><br>V2.0 includes 7 Key new features as well as bug fixing.<br><b>New Features:</b><br>    1. Multiple Resolution Solution<br>       A complete solution of multiple resolutions is provided:<br>       1) Support exporting texture atlas with different dimension in Design Panel.<br>       2) Support importing texture atlas with different dimension plus scale factor to appropriate device-specific resolution.<br>       3) Support creating textures with dynamically scaled vector assets at runtime to appropriate device-specific resolution.<br>    2. Skeleton Reuse and Animation Reuse<br>       1) All of the skeleton hierarchy can be reused for different characters only if they have bones with same name.<br>       2) All of the same animations can be reused for different characters only if they have similar skeleton hierarchy.<br>       3) Animations could be statically reused in Design Panel or dynamically reused in logic.<br>    3. Color/Alpha Transform Animation<br>       1) Support reading Color/alpha transforms data from Flash Pro and rendering.<br>       2) Support setting armature color/alpha in logic.<br>       3) Support mixing of armature and boneâ€™s color/alpha.<br>    4. Changeable Z-Order<br>       Bones could have different Z-order in different key frames.<br>    5. Time Based Animation<br>       Support time based animation as well as frames based. You can easily switch the animation update mode by operating clock.<br>       With the benefit of the clock, global time scale related features can be easily implemented.Remember how Neo stop bullets?<br>    6. External Texture Atlas<br>       You can generate texture atlas yourself and put it into DragonBones.<br>    7. Timeline Event<br>       Support three kinds of timeline event: GotoAndPlay, PlaySound and CustomEvent. <br>       You can easily add these timeline events by editing frame label in Flash Pro. <br>       All these timeline events can be popped up by main skeleton, child skeleton and bones.<br><b>Bug Fixing:</b><br>    1. Fix bug: Context lost handling.<br>    2. Fix bug: Big data importing, relieve JSFL 15s running limit.<br>    3. Fix bug: Sometimes bones' Z-Order get mass at the beginning.<br>
