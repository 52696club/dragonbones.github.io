Updated Tutorials.<br><br><font size='20'><b>V2.0 Release Notes</b></font><br>    V2.0 includes 7 Key new features as well as bug fixing.<br><b>New Features:</b><br>    1. Multiple Resolution Solution<br>       A complete solution of multiple resolutions is provided:<br>       1) Support exporting texture atlas with different dimension in Design Panel.<br>       2) Support importing texture atlas with different dimension plus scale factor to appropriate device-specific resolution.<br>       3) Support creating textures with dynamically scaled vector assets at runtime to appropriate device-specific resolution.<br>    2. Skeleton Reuse and Animation Reuse<br>       1) All of the skeleton hierarchy can be reused for different characters only if they have bones with same name.<br>       2) All of the same animations can be reused for different characters only if they have similar skeleton hierarchy.<br>       3) Animations could be statically reused in Design Panel or dynamically reused in logic.<br>    3. Color/Alpha Transform Animation<br>       1) Support reading Color/alpha transforms data from Flash Pro and rendering.<br>       2) Support setting armature color/alpha in logic.<br>       3) Support mixing of armature and boneâ€™s color/alpha.<br>    4. Changeable Z-Order<br>       Bones could have different Z-order in different key frames.<br>    5. Time Based Animation<br>       Support time based animation as well as frames based. You can easily switch the animation update mode by operating clock.<br>       With the benefit of the clock, global time scale related features can be easily implemented.Remember how Neo stop bullets?<br>    6. External Texture Atlas<br>       You can generate texture atlas yourself and put it into DragonBones.<br>    7. Timeline Event<br>       Support three kinds of timeline event: GotoAndPlay, PlaySound and CustomEvent. <br>       You can easily add these timeline events by editing frame label in Flash Pro. <br>       All these timeline events can be popped up by main skeleton, child skeleton and bones.<br><br><b>Bug Fixing:</b><br>    1. Fix bug: Context lost handling.<br>    2. Fix bug: Big data importing, relieve JSFL 15s running limit.<br>    3. Fix bug: Sometimes bones' Z-Order get mass at the beginning.<br>
