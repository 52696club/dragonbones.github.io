				to:
					Frame amount of the animation blending from other behavior to this behavior.
					This value can be edit in design panel or assign the "tweenTime" parameter in "gotoAndPlay" funtion.
					
				drTW:durationTween
					Frame amount of the behavior duration. 
					Defaultly it is equal to the frame amount of this behavior in Flash Pro, but it can be edit in design panel or dynamiclly changed by assign "duration" parameter in "gotoAndPlay" funtion.
					
				lp:loop
					If the behavior will be auto replay. It can be edit in design panel or dynamiclly changed by assign "loop" parameter in "gotoAndPlay" funtion.
					
				twE:tweenEase
					Loop animation easing. It can be edit in design panel. It will not work unless it is a loop animation. All bones in the behavior will have the same easing value.
